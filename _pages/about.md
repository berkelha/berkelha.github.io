<h1 style="font-size: 40px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Atmosphere, Climate and Ecosystems Lab @ UIC!</h1>

We are housed in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at University of Illinois Chicago. Our research and teaching focus on the interactions between the land surface and atmosphere across landscapes including urban systems, glaciers, forests, grasslands and agricultural system. We emphasize the global carbon and water cycles but also address local problems with impacts on society.


We express solidarity with UIC and the Earth and Environmental Sciences Department efforts to combat racism, discrimination, and inequality. We are committed to expanding and supporting diversity and fostering inclusiveness. We recognize and celebrate the contributions of diverse perspectives and commit to create a welcoming and safe space to work, grow and heal.
